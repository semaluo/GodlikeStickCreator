# Godlike Stick Creator
Create a bootable USB stick with selected systems and programs. Play the computer nerd and help everyone everywhere with a great collection of systems and programs.
Windows is broken? With System Rescue CD you can fix that. Virus installed which doesn't give you access to Windows? Try a scan with the Kaspersky Rescue Disk. Want to chill and play a few videos? Kodibuntu is an awesome media center.

It is the worst thing if you want to fix your mum's computer but you don't have access to awesome tools like Autoruns, Notepad++, Process Explorer etc. and if you'd install them she would ask you in 3 years if the reason why the microwave stopped working is because of that "reparing thing" you did.

## How to use
Just start the program, select the drive you want to use, download the systems you want to install and place them in the `/ISOs` folder, select the applications you want to install, modify the appearance of SysLinux if you want and let the program do it's job.

## Do's and Don'ts
- **DO** format your drive if it isn't NTFS formatted or another bootloader was previously installed (use the format option of the program)
- **DONT** change the volume label of the drive because some systems will fail to boot then
- **DONT** change any configuration files on the usb drive if you aren't 100 % sure what you're doing
- **DONT** blame me if something goes wrong. You're using this tool at your own risk
- **DO** help people with the power of your knowledge and the tools of your usb-stick
